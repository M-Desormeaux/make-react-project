# Make React Project

Simple React project initiator based on [minimal-reactjs-boilerplate](https://github.com/Nikhil-Kumaran/minimal-reactjs-boilerplate) by Nikhil-Kumaran.

Thanks to him this project exists and I am thankful to have found his posts on create-react-app.

## How To

1. Install make-react-project

    - `yarn global add make-react-project`

2. Navigate to the directory you made

    - `cd ${your-project-name}`

3. Develop your project
4. Run the Development environment

    - `yarn dev`

5. Enjoy!

## Comments

Fundementally yarn is not NECESSARY for this to work but it is what I use as my default package management system. I recommend installing it but if enough requests are made I can change the script to use npm instead.

If you get an error it is likely one of three reasons:

-   yarn is not installed (yarn is an alternative to npm, so installing it globally gives you options)

-   the folder name already exists, and since it does not remove folders, you will need to make a new name or delete the old folder.

## Future Additions

-   Final Builds
-   stuff as needed

## Contributing

frankly just drop a pull request and I will give it a look over if I think it fits the project goals.
